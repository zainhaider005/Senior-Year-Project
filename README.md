# Senior-Year-Project
Using Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement (PSLM) Survey (having almost 150,000 observations), performed thorough data analysis (data cleaning/visualization) and econometric exercises to analyze the impact of remittances upon poverty alleviation in Pakistan. Deduced that international remittances can be a significant factor for reducing poverty. Came up with strategic policy recommendations.
